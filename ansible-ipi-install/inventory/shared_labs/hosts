# Required configuration variables for RH Scale Shared Lab Node Prep          #
###############################################################################

## NOTE: You will need to complete both the variables in this section and in
##       the IPI on Baremetal section below. A number of the variables in the
##       lower section have been pre-filled with other variable logic to
##       simplify the deployment in RH shared labs. The IPI on Baremetal
##       section is inherited from the upstream Ansible-IPI automation, so it
##       was preserved in order to limit merge conflicts in the future.

# The real lab public NIC for the deployment node. This is the routable public
# interface for $this node that is being used to install OCP4.
lab_pub_nic="eno1"

# The IPMI credentials for the cluster nodes. It is assumed here that these are
# the same across all nodes. If that is not the case, you will need to adjust
# these manually for each host in the [masters] and [workers] sections below.
lab_ipmi_user="quads"
lab_ipmi_password=""

# List of lab public FQDNs for your master nodes. These are the hostnames as
# assigned in your lab reservation and accessible via the Red Hat internal

# REQUIRES EXACTLY THREE FQDNS
master_fqdns=["mfqdn1", "mfqdn2", "mfqdn3"]

# List of MAC addresses for your master nodes to connect to the provisioning
# network. These should be for the interfaces designated as the "director"
# NICs for your node types. List format must be ["mmac1", "mmac2", "mmac3"]

# REQUIRES EXACTLY THREE MACS
master_prov_macs=["mmac1", "mmac2", "mmac3"]

# REQUIRES EXACTLY THREE MACS
master_bm_macs=["mmac4", "mmac5", "mmac6"]

## NOTE: Worker nodes are optional at deployment time. You can comment out the
##       worker-rlated variables below, and if you do so, you will also need to
##       comment out the entries under the [workers] section further down. The
##       number of workers is flexible, however you need to ensure there is
##       a corresponding entry in the [workers] section for each one defined
##       in these variables.

# List of lab public FQDNs for your worker nodes. These are the hostnames as
# assigned in your lab reservation and accessible via the Red Hat internal
# networks. List format must be ["wfqdn1", "wfqdn2"]

# listed here.

# network. These should be for the interfaces designated as the "director"
# NICs for your node types. List format must be ["wmac1", "wmac2"]

# worker listed here.
worker_bm_macs=["wmac3", "wmac4"]

# List of cluster node NICs to disable. You should disable at least the real
# lab public NIC on each cluster node to avoid DHCP competition and problems.
# You may alternately list other interfaces you wish to disable. Note that by
# default all NICs listed will be disabled on all master and worker nodes. Any
# other needs may require further manual customization outside of this
# inventory file. List format must be ["nic1", "nic2"]
# These should be interface names as recognized by the OS.
