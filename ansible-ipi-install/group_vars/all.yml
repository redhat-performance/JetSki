# This variable is used to point to the foreman server that is used to reimage nodes. This variables is useful in two cases
# 1. When the first node in your allocation (provisioning host) is not having RHEL 8.1 OS, it is automatically rebuilt with 
# RHEL 8.1 as the OCP installer expects the provisioning host to be RHEL 8.1. In some other cases, maybe when you have an 
# existing cluster and are trying to reinstall etc, it might be better to start with a clean provisioning host, in which case this variable
# is also used to reimage the provisioning host in spite of it having RHEL 8.1 on it. This variable changes depending on the lab you are
# using as each lab has its own foreman server. This URL can be deduced from the lab allocation email you receive when your allocation is
# ready. It will be under the paragraph "You can also view/manage your hosts via Foreman:" in the email. It is important to use an https
# prefix even if url in the email has http. Also, the url in email might have the '/hosts' path appended, we can remove 'hosts' from url 
# and have it be https://foreman.example.com for example. If you are having trouble figuring out this variable please look for the 
# pastebins under the "Modifying the ansible-ipi-install/group_vars/all.yml file" section in README.md
